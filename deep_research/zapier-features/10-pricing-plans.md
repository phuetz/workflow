- Paths (the logic, not actions within)
- Delay steps
- Triggers
- Sub-Zap invocations (but actions within do)

## Cost Optimization Tips

- Filters don't count as tasks
- Reduce wasted task consumption

### 2. Consolidate Workflows
- Combine related automations
- Use Paths instead of multiple Zaps
- Reduce trigger overhead

### 3. Optimize Polling
- Use instant triggers when available
- Adjust polling frequency as needed
- Reduce unnecessary checks

### 4. Sub-Zaps for Reuse
- Don't duplicate logic
- Sub-Zap calls are free
- Actions within still count

### 5. Monitor Usage
- Regular usage review
- Identify high-task Zaps
- Optimize or remove unused Zaps

## Enterprise Considerations

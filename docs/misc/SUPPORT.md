## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### What is this platform?

A visual workflow automation platform that helps you connect apps, automate processes, and build integrations without code. Think Zapier or n8n, but with enterprise features and AI capabilities.

#### Is it free?

Yes, the core platform is open source (MIT License). You can self-host for free. We also offer cloud hosting and commercial support.

#### What's the difference from n8n/Zapier?

We offer 15+ advanced features including:
- Multi-agent AI orchestration
- Human-in-the-loop approvals
- Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod)
- Git-like versioning
- Enterprise compliance (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- 400+ integrations
- Complete plugin SDK

See [N8N_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md](./N8N_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed comparison.

### Installation & Setup

#### What are the system requirements?

- **Node.js**: 20.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: 9.0.0 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: 15 or higher
- **Redis**: 7 or higher (optional, for queues and caching)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **CPU**: 2 cores minimum, 4 cores recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB minimum

#### Can I run this on Windows?

Yes, but we recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for best compatibility.

#### How do I upgrade to a new version?

```bash
# 1. Backup your database
npm run backup

# 2. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Run migrations
npm run migrate

# 5. Restart services
npm run dev  # or your production start command
```

See [UPGRADE_NODE_GUIDE.md](./UPGRADE_NODE_GUIDE.md) for version-specific instructions.

### Workflows

#### How many workflows can I create?

No built-in limit. Performance depends on your hardware and database capacity.

#### Can I import workflows from n8n?

Yes! Use the import feature. See [Migration Guide](./docs/migration/from-n8n.md).

#### Can workflows call other workflows?

Yes, use the SubWorkflow node to execute other workflows.

#### How do I schedule workflows?

Use the Schedule node to run workflows on a cron schedule.

#### Can I test workflows without running them?

Yes! Use data pinning to attach test data to nodes, then execute from any node.

### Integrations

#### How many integrations are available?

400+ fully implemented integrations across all major categories.

#### Can I build custom integrations?

Yes! Use our Plugin SDK:
```bash
npx create-workflow-node my-integration
```

See [Plugin Development Guide](./docs/advanced/plugins.md).

#### Do you support OAuth2?

Yes, we support OAuth2 with PKCE for all compatible services.

### Security

#### Is my data encrypted?

Yes:
- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for credentials and sensitive data
- **In transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **In memory**: Secure handling with automatic cleanup

#### Can I use my own encryption keys?

Yes, with enterprise support. Contact us for details.

#### Do you support SSO?

Yes, we support:
- LDAP/Active Directory
- OAuth2/OIDC
- SAML 2.0
- Multi-provider authentication

#### Is this GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2 compliant?

Yes, we provide compliance frameworks for:
- GDPR (EU data protection)
- HIPAA (healthcare data)
- SOC2 Type II (security controls)
- ISO 27001 (information security)

See [Compliance Guide](./docs/compliance.md).

### Performance

#### How many workflows can run simultaneously?

Depends on your hardware. With proper scaling:
- Single server: 50-100 concurrent workflows
- Clustered: 1,000+ concurrent workflows

#### Can I scale horizontally?

Yes! The platform supports horizontal scaling with load balancing.

#### What's the maximum workflow size?

No hard limit, but very large workflows (1,000+ nodes) may have UI performance impacts.

### Troubleshooting

#### Workflows aren't executing

Check:
1. Backend server is running (`npm run dev:backend`)
2. Database connection is working (`npm run migrate`)
3. Workflow is activated (toggle in UI)
4. Credentials are configured correctly
5. Check execution logs for errors

#### "Cannot connect to database" error

1. Verify PostgreSQL is running
2. Check `.env` database connection string
3. Ensure database exists: `createdb workflow`
4. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`

#### Frontend won't start

1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (must be 20+)
2. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
4. Check for port conflicts (port 3000)

See [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for more.

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Here's the process:

1. **Search Existing**: Check if it's already requested
2. **Open Discussion**: Start in [GitHub Discussions - Ideas](https://github.com/OWNER/workflow/discussions/categories/ideas)
3. **Gather Feedback**: Community discussion and upvotes
4. **Create Issue**: If validated, we'll create a tracking issue
5. **Implementation**: Maintainers or community implement

**Good Feature Requests Include**:
- Clear use case: What problem does it solve?
- User story: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- Examples: How would it work?
- Alternatives: What other solutions exist?
- Mockups: Visual representation (if UI feature)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Port already in use"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
# Or use different ports in .env
```

#### Issue: "Migration failed"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: deletes data)
npm run migrate:reset
# Or manually apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### Issue: "Expression evaluation error"

**Solution**:
- Check expression syntax: `{{ $json.field }}`
- Verify data exists at runtime
- Use try/catch in expressions
- Enable debug mode for detailed logs

#### Issue: "Node configuration not saving"

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check network tab for failed requests

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
# .env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
DEBUG=workflow:*
```

This will log:
- All workflow executions
- Expression evaluations
- Database queries
- API requests

### Logs Location

- **Frontend**: Browser console
- **Backend**: `./logs/` directory
  - `error.log` - Error logs
  - `combined.log` - All logs
  - `access.log` - HTTP access logs

### Performance Profiling

Enable performance monitoring:

```bash
npm run dev -- --profile
```

Access profiler at: `http://localhost:3000/__profiler`

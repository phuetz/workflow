SECURITY: Make webhook signature verification mandatory

CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - P1 Priority

This commit addresses a critical security vulnerability (CVSS 9.0) where
webhook endpoints allowed unauthenticated workflow execution.

Vulnerability Details:
- Endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/:id
- Issue: Signature verification was optional
- Impact: Anyone with webhook URL could execute workflows
- CWE: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication), CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification)

Changes:
- Make signature verification MANDATORY for all webhooks
- Reject webhooks without configured secrets (400 Bad Request)
- Reject webhooks without signature headers (401 Unauthorized)
- Reject webhooks with invalid signatures (401 Unauthorized)
- Use timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Add comprehensive documentation and error messages

Breaking Changes:
⚠️ All existing webhooks must be updated to include signatures
⚠️ Migration guide: WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md

Files Modified:
- src/backend/api/routes/webhooks.ts (core security fix)

Files Added:
- src/__tests__/webhookSignatureSecurity.test.ts (15 tests)
- WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md (migration guide)
- SECURITY_ADVISORY_WEBHOOK_2025_01.md (CVE advisory)
- SECURITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md (implementation summary)
- WEBHOOK_SECURITY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (quick reference)

Security Improvements:
✅ HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (industry standard)
✅ Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
✅ No bypass mechanisms or exceptions
✅ Clear error messages for debugging
✅ Comprehensive test coverage (100% security paths)

Migration Timeline:
- Day 1: Deploy fix and publish documentation
- Days 1-7: Migration window for existing webhooks
- Day 7+: All webhooks must have valid signatures

Testing:
npm run test -- webhookSignatureSecurity.test.ts (15/15 passing)
npm run typecheck (no errors)
